The Dockerfiles for front and back are exactly the same as in part 1.
The only changes are in docker-compose.yml:

  change #1: set environment variables for frontend's container (PORT="" and API_URL="/api/")

  change #2 (not relevant): add "build" commands inside docker-compose.yaml, presuming the folders, "back" and "front", 
      contain the cloned git repositories.
