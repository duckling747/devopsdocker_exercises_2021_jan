# step 1:
# change .yml file so that it has same domain, or otherwise browser will complain about CORS error. For example:
  environment:
    - VIRTUAL_HOST=calculator.localtest.me
# (see yml in current directory for more detail)
# step 2:
# scale
docker-compose up --scale compute=10
# step 3:
go to url "calculator.localtest.me" w/ browser and hit that button!
