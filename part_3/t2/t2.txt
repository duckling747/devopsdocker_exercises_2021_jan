Remarks:
I used Github Actions for CI/deployment. The pipeline is definitely not optimal, as it takes some 3-4 minutes on each push to 
compile the app. At first I tried to use "buildx" and a build cache as per the instructions on 
https://docs.docker.com/ci-cd/github-actions/ to prevent useless recompilations, but had trouble preventing the pipeline from 
compiling the app *a second time* when deploying to Heroku, after pushing to Docker Hub. So now it compiles/builds just once 
on each push, without a build cache.
